# Dashlane to 1Password

This is a tool that converts the Dashlane exported file (Unsecured archive (readable) in CSV format), to an 1Password compatible file. I hope this helps people who are switching from Dashlane to 1Password. If you experience an issue, please open an issue on the GitHub project page.
