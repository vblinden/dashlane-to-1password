# Unmaintained/archived
This repository is unmaintained/archived. This small project was made a long time ago and I can't guarantee the working anymore cause I am not using Dashlane or 1Password anymore. Feel free to fork the repo to continue working on this project. 

## Dashlane to 1Password

This is a tool that converts the Dashlane exported file (Unsecured archive (readable) in CSV format), to an 1Password compatible file. I hope this helps people who are switching from Dashlane to 1Password. If you experience an issue, please open an issue on the GitHub project page.
